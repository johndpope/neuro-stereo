## Definitions

Optical flow: the pattern of apparent motion of
objects. One camera, two images, for each pixel find the movement.

Scene flow: the position and direction of each visual point:
z-distance + direction. Two camera, four images.

Stereo vision: estimation of the z-distance from two camera.

Disparity map: difference in image location of objects seen by two
cameras.

Epipolar geometry: geometry of stereo vision: given a disparity map,
compute the z-distance of each point.
